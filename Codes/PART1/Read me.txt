To perform Delaunay triangulation, the above cpp file takes points data in format of x y z coordinate of each point in each line,
 the output will be edges with starting point in one line and end point in the immediate line. ---> [1]

The normals to each point directly from the original points data are calculated using open3d in the following collab link. ---> [2]

The code to compute clusters using kmeans and to remove edges using the clusters and normals data is available in the following collab. This takes input from both [1] and [2].
And the output is the valid edges from CGAL and it is sent to part 2 of the pipeline.
